# i-SHIPMENT: A digital platform for the design of patient-centric supply chains

Niki Triantafyllou, Andrea Bernardi, Matthew Lakelin, Nilay Shah, & Maria M. Papathanasiou

This is the official implementation of our *Scientific Reports* 2022 [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-21290-5#Sec12).

## Model
In this repository, you can find the python code for the i-SHIPMENT model (model_CART_iSHIPMENT.py). The i-SHIPMENT model is a flow-based facility location - patient allocation MILP model for the optimization of personalised CAR T-cell therapy manufacturing and distribution.

## Dataset
In this repository, you can find the MIP instances for randomized demand scenarios of increasing size (from 200 to 3000 patients per year).
